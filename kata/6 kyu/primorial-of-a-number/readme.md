# [Primorial Of a Number ](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a99a03e4a6b34bb3c000124)

# Definition (Primorial Of a Number)

_Is similar to factorial of a number_, **_In primorial_**, not all the natural numbers get multiplied, **_only prime numbers are multiplied to calculate the primorial of a number_**. It's denoted with **_P_**<sub>**_#_**</sub>.

---

# Task

**_Given_** _a number N_ , **_calculate its primorial_**. ![!alt](https://i.imgur.com/mdX8dJP.png) ![!alt](https://i.imgur.com/mdX8dJP.png)

---

# Notes

- **_Only positive_** numbers _will be passed (N > 0)_ .

---

# Input >> Output Examples:

```cpp
1- numPrimorial (3) ==> return (30)
```

## **_Explanation_**:

**_Since_** _the passed number is (3)_ ,**_Then_** **_the primorial_** _should obtained by multiplying_ `2 * 3 * 5 = 30 .`

### Mathematically written as , **_P_**<sub>3</sub>**_#_** = 30 .

---

```cpp
2- numPrimorial (5) ==> return (2310)
```

## **_Explanation_**:

**_Since_** _the passed number is (5)_ ,**_Then_** **_the primorial_** _should obtained by multiplying_ `2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 = 2310 .`

### Mathematically written as , **_P_**<sub>5</sub>**_#_** = 2310 .

---

```cpp
3- numPrimorial (6) ==> return (30030)
```

## **_Explanation_**:

**_Since_** _the passed number is (6)_ ,**_Then_** **_the primorial_** _should obtained by multiplying_ `2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 = 30030 .`

### Mathematically written as , **_P_**<sub>6</sub>**_#_** = 30030 .
